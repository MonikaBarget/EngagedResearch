# EngagedResearch

This repository is dedicated to "engaged research", "public humanities" and related fields.

The material shared includes:

- instructions, game board and cards for the **"engage!" game** that introduces humanities scholars, archivists and curators to the possibilities of public engagement

- lecture on "public humanities" held in the "digital methods" MA programme at JGU Mainz in October 2019

- slides created for a workshop on "serious game" and digital games in teaching and research communication in April 2021

- poster and instructions for the "journey with me" mobile phone app game created by [Dr. Siobhán McPhee](http://www.geog.ubc.ca/persons/siobhan-mcphee/) and team at the University of British Columbia 

If you are playing "Journey with Me", please let Siobhán know about your experiences.
